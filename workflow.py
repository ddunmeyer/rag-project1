# -----------
# This file improves retrieval quality using multi-step AI workflows.
#
# The retrieval quality problem:
# The quality of a RAG answer depends heavily on what gets retrieved.
# And what gets retrieved depends on how similar the query embedding is
# to the document embeddings. If the user's query is vague or uses
# different vocabulary than the documents, retrieval suffers.
#
# Two solutions:
#
# 1. Query rewriting: Use an LLM to rewrite the user's question into a
#    version that will produce a better embedding for semantic search.
#    "tell me about that database thing" → "How do relational databases
#    store and query structured data using SQL?"
#
# 2. Query decomposition: Some questions are actually multiple questions.
#    Split them up and retrieve separately, then combine the results.
#    This is called "multi-hop retrieval."

    # --- The RAG concept ---
    # Embeddings capture meaning, but they're sensitive to phrasing.
    # A user might type casually ("how does python deal with dbs?") while
    # documents are written formally ("Python database connectivity and ORMs").
    # These two phrasings may not be close in embedding space even though
    # they mean the same thing. Query rewriting bridges that gap.
    #
    # Also important: if the user asks a follow-up like "What else can it do?",
    # the conversation_context lets you resolve "it" to the right topic.
    #
    # Steps:
    #   1. If conversation_context is not empty, include it in the prompt
    #   2. Build a prompt asking Gemini to rewrite the question to be more
    #      specific and technical, suitable for semantic search
    #   3. Call _client.models.generate_content() with temperature=0.1
    #      (low temperature = focused rewriting, not creative)
    #   4. Return response.text.strip() if it's not empty and under 500 chars
    #   5. Wrap in try/except — if anything fails, return original_query unchanged
