# RAG Learning App

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with Python, ChromaDB, SentenceTransformers, and Google Gemini. You'll build this incrementally over Weeks 10–15.

## What This App Does

You can ask this app questions about Python, machine learning, databases, APIs, and AI concepts. It finds the most relevant documents from its knowledge base and sends them to Gemini as context — so the answers are grounded in real information rather than guesswork.

## System Architecture

See **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** for the full Week 16 diagram and component explanations.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd student-rag-project
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:
- **Mac/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`
- **Windows:** `venv\Scripts\activate`

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up your Gemini API key

Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and replace `your-gemini-api-key-here` with your actual key.

### 5. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app opens in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Optional CLI test:

```bash
python langchain_demo.py "What is Python?"
```

Set `RAG_MODE=react` in `.env` for the ReAct agent. See [LANGCHAIN.md](LANGCHAIN.md).

## Assignment: Week 10 — Run the Starter App

**Learning objective:** Understand how a basic RAG pipeline works end-to-end.

### Background

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) connects a vector database to an LLM. Instead of asking the LLM to answer from memory (which leads to hallucination), we first *retrieve* relevant documents from our knowledge base, then *augment* the LLM's prompt with those documents so it can generate a *grounded* answer.

This week, everything is already built. Your job is to run it, understand how the pieces fit together, and answer the reflection questions below.

### What to do

1. Follow the Setup instructions above and get the app running
2. Ask the app at least 3 questions — try both on-topic and off-topic questions
3. Read through these four files and make sure you understand what each one does:
   - `data_loader.py` — where does the knowledge base come from?
   - `embeddings.py` — what does `embed_text()` return, and why?
   - `vector_store.py` — what does ChromaDB store, and how does `query_similar()` work?
   - `rag_pipeline.py` — trace a question from `run_rag()` all the way to a returned answer

### Reflection questions (be ready to discuss in class)

- What would happen if you asked a question that no document in the knowledge base covers?
- Why do we store vector embeddings instead of just the original text?
- What is the difference between keyword search and semantic search?

### ✅ When done

## Assignment: Week 11 — Conversation Context

**Learning objective:** Understand how to give an LLM memory using in-context history.

### Background

LLMs have no memory between API calls. Every call starts completely fresh. This means if you ask "What is Python?" and then "Can you give an example?", the second call has no idea what "it" refers to.

The solution used in every production chatbot is simple: before each API call, paste the recent conversation history directly into the prompt. The LLM "remembers" because *we tell it* what was said before. This is called **in-context memory**.

### What to implement

**File 1 — `conversation.py`**

Implement `get_formatted_history()`. This method formats the stored messages as a plain-text block that can be pasted into a prompt. Read the TODO comment carefully — the format matters.

**File 2 — `rag_pipeline.py`**

Find the **Week 11 TODO** block inside `generate_answer()`. Replace the placeholder `history_section = ""` with logic that:
1. Checks if `conversation_history` is not None and has messages
2. Gets the formatted history with `conversation_history.get_formatted_history()`
3. Sets `history_section` to `f"\nPrevious conversation:\n{history_text}\n"`

Then find the second **Week 11 TODO** block (at the bottom of `run_rag()`). After the answer is generated, save the exchange:
```python
conversation_history.add_message("user", query)
conversation_history.add_message("assistant", answer)
```

### How to test

Run the app and try a two-part conversation:
1. Ask: *"What is machine learning?"*
2. Ask: *"What are some real-world examples of it?"*

Without your implementation, the second answer will be generic. With it, the answer will reference machine learning specifically.

### ✅ When done
Check off **Week 11** in the Weekly Progress section above, then delete this entire Week 11 assignment section.
